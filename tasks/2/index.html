        <h3>
          The Cybersecurity Hub was established by the then Department of
          Telecommunications and Postal Services in 2015. Since then it has
          matured as one of the national Computer Security Incident Response
          Teams and is in the processes of increasing its service offerings to
          the public and industry. Cybersecurity is a shared responsibility and
          the development of public-private partnerships is one of the key
          mandates of the Cybersecurity Hub
        </h3>
      </div>
      <br />
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          The Cybersecurity Hub is mandated by the National Cybersecurity Policy
          Framework (NCPF) which was passed by Cabinet in March 2012. The
          Cybersecurity Hub is South Africa’s National Computer Security
          Incident Response Team (CSIRT) and strives to make Cyberspace an
          environment where all residents of South Africa can safely
          communicate, socialise, and transact in confidence. It achieves this
          by working with stakeholders from government, the private sector,
          civil society and the public with a view to identifying and countering
          cybersecurity threats.
          <br />
          <br />
          The Cybersecurity Hub enhances interaction, consultations and promotes
          a coordinated approach regarding engagements with the private sector
          and civil society. As a key point of contact for cybersecurity
          matters, it coordinates cybersecurity response activities, and
          facilitates information and technology sharing.
          <br />
          <br />
          The Cybersecurity Hub also provides information that creates awareness
          on cybersecurity as well as information that encourages South African
          citizens and organisations to be secure online.
