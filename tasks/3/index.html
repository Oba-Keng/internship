        <h3>
          Due to the ongoing COVID-2019 Pandemic, all caregivers/patients are
          required to complete this form prior to being seen at any medical
          facility. Your visit is subject to approval upon completion of this
          form. Effective immediately, only 1 adult is to accompany our patient
          visits (except for newborn visits), accompanying children who are not
          being seen as patients are also restricted. These rules are being
          enforced to keep our patients and staff as well as the rest of your
          loved ones safe and healthy.
